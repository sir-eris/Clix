            YOU AND Clix AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING

            DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO

            arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. However, we
            agree that if your claim is small enough that the law allows you to
            file it in a small claims court, you may do so instead of submitting

            REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. If a court refuses to enforce
            the waiver of class-wide arbitration, this entire arbitration
            provision shall be unenforceable and any claims brought on behalf of
            a putative class will proceed in court. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM
            PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT
            TO A JURY TRIAL. The parties shall maintain the confidential nature
            of the arbitration proceeding and any award, including the
            arbitration hearing, except as may be necessary to prepare for or
            conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be
            necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary
            remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement, or
            unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision. The
            arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or
            videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the
            arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person
            hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a
            location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due
            consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
            circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location,
            such determination should be made by JAMS or by the arbitrator. The
            arbitrator’s decision will follow the terms of these Terms of
            Service and will be final and binding. In any arbitration arising
            out of or related to this agreement, there shall be no
            interrogatories or requests to admit. IN ANY ARBITRATION ARISING OUT
            OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE ARBITRATOR(S) ARE NOT EMPOWERED
            TO AWARD PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EXCEPT WHERE PERMITTED BY
            STATUTE, AND THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY SUCH
            DAMAGES. THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY NOT AWARD ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS. As stated
            in Section 18 of these Terms of Service, Arizona law governs this
            entire agreement, but the parties acknowledge that this agreement
            evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and that
            notwithstanding Section 18, any arbitration conducted pursuant to
            the terms of this agreement shall be governed by the Federal
            Arbitration Act.
